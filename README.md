# IRIS Dataset

The task objective of the IRIS dataset project was to develop a classification model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its features, such as sepal length and width, and petal length and width. My approach involved loading the dataset using pandas, exploring its structure, and creating visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to analyze relationships and distributions. I trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the dataset, achieving an accuracy of around 96-98%. The results provided insights into the effectiveness of SVM in classification tasks and the importance of feature normalization.

# Loan Prediction Dataset

The task objective of the Loan Prediction dataset project was to train a classification model that can predict loan approval based on factors like loan amount, education, and income. My approach involved handling missing data, visualizing key features, and training a classification model like Logistic Regression or Decision Tree. I evaluated the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix, gaining insights into the performance of different classification algorithms and the impact of feature engineering on model accuracy. By analyzing the results, I was able to identify key factors influencing loan approval predictions.

# Churn Modelling Dataset

The task objective of the Churn Modelling dataset project was to develop a classification model that can predict customer churn based on various customer attributes. My approach involved cleaning and preparing the dataset, encoding categorical features like geography and gender, and training a classification model. By analyzing feature importance, I gained insights into the factors that influence customer churn, such as customer demographics and behavior. The results provided valuable information for businesses to develop targeted strategies to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction
